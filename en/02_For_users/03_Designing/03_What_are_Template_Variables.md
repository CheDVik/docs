## What are TV Settings? ##

A TV parameter in Evolution CMS is an element that contains specific information for the current page. They can be displayed on the page, or pass the snippet as a parameter.

TV processing in a template can be completely different - widgets, sliders, data tables, anything. Also in the administration panel - the external view of the TV parameter can be either just a text field, or a checkbox, a list, a table, a multi-field.

#### Example parameter:
[*myParam*]
