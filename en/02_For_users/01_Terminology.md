## Template ##
Template - the main part of the page of the site, which determines its design. The template does not require special syntax and is a simple HTML code (and possibly XHTML or other) with the call of the necessary chunks, parameters and snippets.

The number of templates most often depends on the appearance and functionality of the site. As a rule, templates are created for various sections and pages of the site.

For example, it will be logical to create different templates for the product and for the news and attach various TV parameters to them. This will allow the content manager to fill the site faster and more correctly. It will also greatly facilitate the work of a programmer if you need to make some news feeds or products.

## Chunk ##
A chunk is a small piece of HTML code or other information that can be reused in a template, other chunk, or snippet.

## TV Parameter ##
TB parameter - an element that contains certain information for the current page. Parameters can be directly displayed on the page or pass a snippet as a parameter.

## Snippet ##
A snippet is a PHP code that displays the result of its work in the place of the template/chunk where the call to this snippet is placed.

Typically, snippets are used to output dynamically changing content. They can be used to create menus, comments, news feeds, blogs or any other functionality that is possible in the php language in conjunction with the Evolution API system.
